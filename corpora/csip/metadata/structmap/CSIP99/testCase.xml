      The schema division div element's @LABEL attribute has the value "Schemas" from the vocabulary.

  <description>
    CSIP99 seems identical to CSIP97, but the authors of the specification
    had a distinction in mind: "â€¦ the first requirement defines whether the
    division itself is mandatory, the second defines the required label
    value," see the issue "Redundancies and incompatible priority levels" at
    https://github.com/DILCISBoard/E-ARK-CSIP/issues/570. The cases of there
    being no schema division or more than one schema division
    are handled in CSIP97. Consequently, there is only one rule left for
    CSIP99:
      If the schema division exists, it MUST have @LABEL='Schemas'.

    This, however, is not reliably testable with algorithms of reasonable
    complexity. Detecting a schema division that is not marked
    @LABEL='Schemas' would require analysing indirect indicators (e.g. a
    structMap/div with references to files in a folder named "schemas"), but
    these cannot give enough confidence to announce a violation of a MUST
    rule.

    In sum, only valid IPs are meaningful for CSIP99 and the requirement is
    effectively not testable.
