  <description>This attribute has the cardinality of 0..1 and moscow-level MAY which is also the case in METS.xsd. There could be a test to see how many files have metadata file IDs, but this is at a nice-to-have-level and not really a requirement so all in all there are no rules connected with this testcase</description>
