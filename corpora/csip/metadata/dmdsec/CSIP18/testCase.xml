  <requirementText>An identifier for the descriptive metadata section (dmdSec) used for referencing inside the package. It must be unique within the package.
The ID must follow the rules for xml:id described in the chapter of the textual description of CSIP named "General requirements for the use of metadata"

  <!-- Textual description of the test case, extra notes beyond the requirment text. -->
  <description>CSIP18 is a requirement which is identical with 26 other requirements in CS IP, since it is a requirement for the use of ID's in accordance with the XML-standard. IDs are used multiple times in the elements of METS. The requirement links to http://earkcsip.dilcis.eu/#the-use-of-identifiers
    
    The requirements for the use of identifiers are several:
    
    There MUST be one ID-attribute. (Will be tested with general schema validation)
    ID MUST begin with a letter, or an underscore character (‘_’). (Will be tested with general schema validation)
    ID MUST contain no characters other than letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, full stops, and certain combining and extension characters. (Will be tested with general schema validation)
    ID MUST start with a prefix, followed by the value of the identifier.
    It is required that any selected prefix is used consistently throughout the package.
    It MUST be unique within the package. (Will be tested with general schema validation)
    4, and 5 is hard to test, as there is no place where the prefix can be identified.</description>
