  <description>
    CSIP103 seems identical to CSIP101, but the authors of the
    specification had a distinction in mind: "… the first requirement
    defines whether the division itself is mandatory, the second defines
    the required label value," see the issue "Redundancies and
    incompatible priority levels" at
    https://github.com/DILCISBoard/E-ARK-CSIP/issues/570. The cases of
    there being no 'Representations' division or more than one
    'Representations' division are handled in CSIP101. Consequently, there
    is only one rule left for CSIP103:
      If the 'Representations' division exists, it MUST have @LABEL='Representations'.

    This, however, is not reliably testable with algorithms of reasonable
    complexity. Detecting a representations division that is not marked
    @LABEL='Representations' would require analysing indirect indicators (e.g. a
    structMap/div with references to files in the /representations folder), but
    these cannot give enough confidence to announce a violation of a MUST
    rule.

    In sum, only valid IPs are meaningful for CSIP103 and the requirement is
    effectively not testable.
