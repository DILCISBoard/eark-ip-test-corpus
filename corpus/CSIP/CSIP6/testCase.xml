      <!--  Ideally, there should be a test if the URL resolves (i.e.
            is a valid URL according to RFC3986) and can be dereferenced
            (i.e. points to an actual XML file).

            mets.xsd defines mets/@PROFILE as xsd:string, although
            xsd:anyURI would be more precise. One way to test if the URL
            resolves would be to redefine the attribute as xsd:anyURI in
            DILCIS extension schema
            https://DILCIS.eu/XML/METS/CSIPExtensionMETS, letting schema
            validation take care of it. Another would be to implement the
            xsd:anyURI validation in schematron.

            Dereferencing is first a specification issue: as of CSIP
            v.2.0.3 there is no requirement for the URL to point to an actual
            file. Also, no indication of whether it should be a publicly
            accessible http:// URL or a local one pointing to a file inside
            the package. Currently, a valid interpretation is that the URL
            can be just an abstract identifier, like the URL of a namespace.
            Therefore, it would not be correct to implement a dereferencing
            test.

            In conclusion, the proper approach now seems to have the
            validator test for a non-empty string. And raise the issue to the
            A2 team to clarify the wording of CSIP6.
            
            It seems a good idea to add a "WARNING" level dereferencing test
            to the validator, but it would be improper to include it in the
            testCase.xml because such requirement does not come from the
            specification. -->
